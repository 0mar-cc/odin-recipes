                <p class="step">Fill a separate saucepan with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.</p>
            
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p class="step">Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is lightly browned. Pour in the tomatoes and season with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Simmer over medium heat for 10 to 20 minutes.</p>

                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p class="step">In a large serving dish, stir together the lentils, rice and macaroni. Mix in the tomato sauce until evenly coated.</p>
